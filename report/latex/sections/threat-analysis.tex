\begin{itemize}
    \item Third party apps
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Test
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Test environment}
For the analysis the decision was made to use Linux operating systems as it is a popular choice in the system security community and a large number of materials use it.
The chosen distribution was Kali Linux because it comes with already preinstalled toolset.
