\section{Threat analysis}
\subsection{Focus of the analysis}
The amount of software, watch models, and the fact that firmware is being constantly developed makes it infeasible to cover everything in a single publication.
I decided to focus on the analysis of the third party apps, as it is the most interesting topic and unique to Garmin devices.
The previous research found multiple vulnerabilities in the third party apps runtime affecting over a hundred devices\cite{broken-vm,compromising-garmin-watches}.
Moreover, both of the articles mention that the analysis was far from being comprehensive.
Even though Garmin software is a closed source, the researchers were able to find multiple problems in the runtime environment.
This suggests that there might be potentially more bugs in the software that is worth investigating.

\subsection{Attack surface}
As the focus of the report is third party apps, the attack surface is limited to the apps and the store.
There are two apparent ways of exploiting the apps that need to be considered:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Malicious app installation without the user's knowledge.

    \item Runtime exploitation
\end{itemize}

In the report, the following attack surfaces will be analyzed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Connect IQ Store
    \item Third party apps
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Installation process
        \item Permissions
        \item Isolation
        \item Communication with the companion app
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
