\chapter{Conclusion}
\section{Summary}

The goal of the project was to analyze the security of the Garmin watches and the third-party apps.
During the analysis, the ecosystem of the Garmin watches was investigated.
As the Garmin software is proprietary, it was required to reverse-engineer the software in some cases.
Based on the exploration, different vectors of attack were considered.

TODO: elaborate, add conclusions


\section{Future work}

With the limited time and a broad scope of the analysis, it was not possible to cover all the possible attack vectors.
Additionally, parts of the analysis were not as deep as they could be.
The following list describes the possible future work that could be done to expand the analysis.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Investigation into the findings from the fuzzy testing.
    Analyze the crashes and try to exploit them.
    Additionally, test if those bugs affect real devices.
    \item Further analysis of the mobile Garmin apps.
    Connect IQ store could be analyzed more deeply.
    Other Garmin apps could be analyzed as well.
    \item Reverse engineering of the firmware/virtual machine.
    Performing a static analysis of the firmware or simulator could reveal more findings.
\end{itemize}
