\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Garmin fitness watches}

In the past years fitness trackers experienced a high growth in popularity.
As the technology develops, the devices get more affordable and are able to track more metrics.
While it improves the insights into health and fitness tracking, it also means that it collects more sensitive data about the users.

Garmin fitness watches can accompany the users day and night, being able to last even over a week on a single charge.
They offer a wide range of sensors such as heart rate, pulse oximeter, temperature, gps, compass, accelerometer, gyroscope, altimeter and barometer, light sensor.
This allows collecting and calculating an enormous amount of different sensitive metrics.
As a result, the potential consequences of unauthorized access to the user's data are severe.

The watches can work independently, collecting and processing the data offline.
However, Garmin offers an extensive set of software to improve the user's experience.
There are multiple apps available for iPhone and Android phones to manage the watch and the data.
This means that the data is being sent over a Bluetooth protocol from the watch to the phone.
Additionally, Garmin recommends synchronizing the data with their cloud.

In case the provided software does not fulfill users' requirements, it is also possible to install third party apps on the watch.
Garmin maintains an ecosystem of tools for the developers to create apps and publish them in a Garmin store.
It makes the watch extensible and more universal, but it also allows for a third party developer to gain access to some of the user data.

The described software offers a powerful toolset for the analysis of fitness data for every user.
However, it also creates a large number of possible attack surfaces.
It is also important to notice that the Garmin software is not open source, and there is no bounty program for finding vulnerabilities.

In this report, a broad analysis of different vector attacks has been performed.

Overall, during the analysis, the following privacy and security concerns were found:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Garmin uses deprecated SHA-1 for app signing
    \item Android apps installed on the phone, without any permissions can detect that the user uses Garmin devices and the type of the device
    \item Communication between the third party apps and their companion apps are in plain text, available to all apps installed on the Android phone
    \item Permission system of the third party watch apps is not as well separated into different categories as it is in Android, iOS phones.
    \item Fuzzy testing suggests that it may be possible to escape the virtual machine that is running the third party apps.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software description}

For the purpose of the analysis, when Garmin watches are mentioned, this report focuses on Garmin Fenix watches series 7.
Other devices may offer different hardware and software features.

Garmin created SDK for third party app development.
It is integrated with Visual Studio Code through the Monkey C extension.
There is an official documentation describing the development process with Visual Studio Code.
However, it doesn't describe the specific scripts and tools contained in the SDK that are used by the extension.
The SDK consists mostly of Java class used for compiling and packaging the application.
Additionally, a simulator is provided for testing the apps.
Unfortunately, it is implemented as a binary ELF file, which makes the reverse engineering more difficult.
Moreover, other scripts are provided for other tasks such as uploading an app to the simulator.

List of tools:

\begin{itemize}
    \item monkeybrains.jar - compiles and build the project
    \item simulator - simulates a chosen Garmin device
    \item monkeydo - executes Connect IQ executable on the simulator
    \item Other scripts: barrelbuild, barreltest, connectiq, era, mdd, monkeyc, monkeygraph, monkeydoc, shell, monkeymotion
\end{itemize}
