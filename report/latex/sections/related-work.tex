Different attempts at the security analysis of Garmin software are available online.
However, it is far from being extensive.
The amount of software, watch models and the fact that firmware is being constantly developed makes it infeasible to cover everything in a single publication.
There were attempts to ethically hack a Garmin watch[1][2], analyzing different vectors of attack such as the Garmin Connect website, watch communication, and third-party apps.
However, they did not go deep into any of those topics.
Others tried to reverse engineer Garminâ€™s Virtual Machine and firmware format[3][4][5].
While they explored the specific topic deeper, there is still a long list of things that could be explored.
Previous attempts used an available beta firmware for the analysis and used watches released over 4 years ago.
Since then, many new models have been introduced as well as new firmware versions with new features and expanded developer SDK.
